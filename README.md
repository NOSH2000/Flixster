### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I had difficulty running the app on Android Studio the first couple of times. I did not realize that we were not supposed to check the android.support libries option.
- I changed the text font to ```serif```. However, while the change reflected on the emulator, it did not show on OnePlus device.
- I added an app icon but it is blurry and not what I wanted it to look like.

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
